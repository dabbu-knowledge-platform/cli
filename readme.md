# Dabbu CLI

[![Code Style and Build Check](https://github.com/dabbu-knowledge-platform/cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dabbu-knowledge-platform/cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A CLI that leverages the Dabbu API and neatly retrieves your files and folders scattered online.

## Intro

Tired of having your files and folders randomly scattered about online with multiple providers like Google Drive and One Drive? Want to access all your files and folders using a single, unified interface? Dabbuâ€™s APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow you to access your files and folders from any provider (Google Drive, Gmail, Microsoft OneDrive, etc) from a single, unified interface. Behind these APIs is a software layer that connects to these providers and returns your files and folders in one unified format. We'll let this GIF do the talking:

What you just saw there was Dabbu CLI in action - a simple program in javascript that leverages the Dabbu API to bring your files and folders to your fingertips from all over the web.

**This repo contains the CLI application's source code. To view and install the server that handles API calls from clients like this one, go [here](https://github.com/gamemaker1/dabbu-server).**

## Getting started

The installation can be done manually on Linux, Alpine Linux, MacOS, Android (Requires Termux) and Windows (Currently only 64-bit architectures are supported).

## Providers supported

_And more to come...!_
